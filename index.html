      <p>I felt a lot more exhausted this Tuesday&nbsp;than last week. It was very difficult to stay awake, but I persevered. After the 10:00 a.m. news meeting, I shadowed Leon Hendrix, a reporter, for a couple of hours. We went to the 61st District Court to gather public records on a man who sneaked into an elementary school and tried to assault two girls in Grand Rapids. It was interesting to see several people approach Leon once they recognized him inside the courthouse. One man said recognized Leon and asked if he was a WOOD TV8 reporter. Leon confirmed that he is and gave the man his business card.</p>
      <p>It was nice talking to Leon about the journalism field once we left the courthouse. I told him that one of my biggest fears reporting live is having a laugh attack on air. Leon said he never really thought about something like that happening, but he has had some bizarre encounters while reporting live. One example was of a little girl trying to take his microphone away from him while he was on air. She threw a tantrum when he tried to get her away from him. Moral of the story: Expect anything to happen&nbsp;on air.</p>

      <p>When we got back, I wrote one story for the web, then shadowed the web staff and producers for the rest of my shift.</p>
      <p>I immediately put on my pajamas and got ready for bed once I got back to East Lansing.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a worst case scenario I worry about for myself. In September 2015, Robert Bradfield, reporter and weekend anchor for WPSD in Paducah, Kentucky, could not stop laughing after trying to read a story about a pig named Chris P. Bacon:</p>
